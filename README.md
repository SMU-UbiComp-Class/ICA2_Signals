# UbiComp In Class Assignment Two
In this repository find code for manipulating signals in python. Specifically, there are scripts for sampling and displaying the FFT from the audio card, as well as using a microcontroller. 

The python examples are shown using jupyter notebook, where possible. 
Please note these are learning exercises and the code and methods used here are updated throughout the semester. Code here is chosen for simplicity, not efficiency. 

To run the examples you will need the following packages:
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- numpy
- pyserial
- scipy

All of which can be installed using anaconda (the method I selected). 

You can alos optionally install
- pyaudio (optional)

However, you will need to run it on top of portaudio. There are various instructions online for getting this up and running, but it is not as simple as most other python packages. That is because the portaudio package must be built specifically for your version of python and your OS.
